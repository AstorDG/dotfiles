[general]

# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.

# Cava will automatically increase the higher cutoff if a too low band is specified.

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'fifo', 'portaudio', 'pipewire', 'alsa', 'pulse', 'sndio', 'oss', 'jack' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'oss', 'pipewire', 'sndio', 'jack', 'pulse', 'alsa', 'portaudio' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
# On Mac it defaults to 'portaudio' or 'fifo'
# On windows this is automatic and no input settings are needed.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio and pipewire 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For pipewire 'source' will be the object name or object.serial of the device to capture from.
# Both input and output devices are supported.
#
# I'm leaving all the methods because deleting them caused weird behaviour

[output]
